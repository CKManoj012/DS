ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio!
I'm a Data Scientist with a passion for turning raw data into actionable insights. My work bridges the gap between data and decision-making, blending creativity with analytical rigor to solve real-world business problems. From predictive modeling and machine learning to deep dives into customer segmentation, time series forecasting, and market basket analysis â€” my projects are designed to showcase the full spectrum of my data science skills.

On this GitHub, youâ€™ll find code implementations of key use cases across multiple domains, such as:

ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Forecasting: Predict future trends with historical data, perfect for demand planning and financial analysis.
ðŸ‘¥ Customer Segmentation: Uncover hidden patterns in consumer behavior using clustering and classification techniques.
ðŸ›’ Market Basket Analysis: Leverage association rules to unlock the power of cross-selling strategies.
ðŸ“Š Survey Analysis: Extract actionable insights from customer feedback to drive smarter decisions.
ðŸ’¡ Financial Analytics: Apply advanced models for portfolio optimization and risk assessment.
Beyond code, I believe in data-driven decision making and continuously learning new tools and techniques to sharpen my expertise. I am committed to writing clean, efficient, and scalable code that makes data insights accessible to all.

Letâ€™s collaborate and make data work for us! ðŸš€
