# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio!

I'm a **Data Scientist** with a passion for turning raw data into actionable insights. My work bridges the gap between data and decision-making, blending creativity with analytical rigor to solve real-world business problems. From **predictive modeling** and **machine learning** to deep dives into **customer segmentation**, **time series forecasting**, and **market basket analysis** â€” my projects are designed to showcase the full spectrum of my data science skills.

There are also samples of Text Analytics and Generative AI, where I have demonstrated some use cases where power of LLM's are leveraged.
I have used LangChain, HuggingFace, Pinocone and OpenAI APIs to build these samples.

On this GitHub, youâ€™ll find code implementations of key use cases across multiple domains, such as:

- ðŸ“ˆ **Time Series Forecasting**: Predict future trends with historical data, perfect for demand planning and financial analysis.
  
- ðŸ‘¥ **Customer Segmentation**: Uncover hidden patterns in consumer behavior using clustering and classification techniques.
  
- ðŸ›’ **Market Basket Analysis**: Leverage association rules to unlock the power of cross-selling strategies.
  
- ðŸ“Š **Survey Analysis**: Extract actionable insights from customer feedback to drive smarter decisions.
  
- ðŸ’¡ **Financial Analytics**: Apply advanced models for portfolio optimization and risk assessment.

- ðŸ’¬ **Conversational AI Chatbot**: Chatbot where LLMs are used in generating responses for the custom document data.

Beyond code, I believe in **data-driven decision making** and continuously learning new tools and techniques to sharpen my expertise. I am committed to writing clean, efficient, and scalable code that makes data insights accessible to all.

Letâ€™s collaborate and make data work for us! ðŸš€
