# Market Basket Analysis: Uncovering Shopping Trends for Business Insights üõçÔ∏èüìä

**Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** is a powerful technique used by businesses to identify product associations and customer purchasing patterns. By analyzing transaction data, it reveals which items are frequently bought together, providing valuable insights for optimizing store layouts, improving product recommendations, and creating targeted marketing strategies.

At the core of MBA is **Association Rule Mining**, which helps extract meaningful relationships between products using key metrics like:

- **Support**: How often items appear together.
- **Confidence**: The likelihood that one product leads to the purchase of another.
- **Lift**: The strength of a rule over random chance.

This notebook applies MBA techniques using algorithms such as **Apriori** and **FP-Growth** to analyze grocery data. It interprets association rules in detail, providing actionable insights for business decision-making. This project serves as a practical demonstration of my expertise in data mining and analytics, showcasing my ability to derive insights that drive business value.
