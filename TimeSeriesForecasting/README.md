# Time Series Forecasting: A Journey through Time 🌍⏳

Time series forecasting is a fascinating field that allows us to predict the future by analyzing data points collected over time. From stock market predictions 📈 to weather forecasts 🌦️, time series analysis helps us make informed decisions in many areas of life. By identifying patterns, seasonality, and trends, we can build models that give us insights into what might happen next.

In this notebook, we’ll dive deep into the world of time series analysis by focusing on **univariate time series forecasting**—where we study a single variable over time. Using the powerful SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, we’ll resample the data to capture seasonal effects and trends, making our predictions even more precise.

## Notebook Overview

In this analysis, we will:

- Explore and resample time series data to reveal underlying trends and seasonality.
- Perform **univariate time series forecasting** using the **SARIMA** model.
- Evaluate the model's performance to ensure robust predictions.
  
### Key Steps:
1. **Data Exploration and Resampling**: We begin by visualizing and resampling the data to prepare it for seasonal forecasting.
2. **SARIMA Model Building**: The SARIMA model is well-suited for handling both seasonal and non-seasonal components in the data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: We'll assess the accuracy of the forecast by comparing predicted values to actual data.

Let’s dive in and see what the future holds for our time series! 🚀📊
